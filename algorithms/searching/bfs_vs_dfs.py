# If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
# BFS (because it starts searching the closest nodes to the parent first)

# If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
# BFS (DFS will take long)

# If the tree is very wide:
# DFS (BFS will need to much memory)

# If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
# DFS (will find an answer quicker than BFS)

# Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
# DFS

# Finding the shortest path:
# BFS
